# NodeJS Website

## Development

To install dependancies and build UI:

Install "npm package manager" for the command line

$ npm install

$ grunt

Three files will define your dev installation:

`config/settings.js` (build yours based on `settings.shadow.js`)

Run the server by using `nodejs server/bin/www`.
